Access to relevant care as well as its availability are often limited due to: a) lack of respective qualified resources b) linguistically, cultural and even racial barriers in addressing of mental health care needs of cross-cultural patient population. By use of various e-Mental health applications, primarily videoconference, we may improve assessment and/or treatment of refugees and asylum seekers on distance e.g. Arabic speaking psychiatrist located in Sweden would be able to assess and/or treat refugees from Syria located in Germany). Specialized centers for treatment of refugees would also be able to get second-opinion service from remote experts and use it in order to confirm or re-consider diagnosis as well as the treatment options. Establishment of international network of cross-cultural experts enables to: – Improve the mental health care across national boundaries by providing psychiatric consultations to other countries within EU – Conduct International Treatment Team with Select Skills (e.g. Sign Language and Many Foreign Languages Staff) – Provide Distance Supervision and Staff Consultation – Provide Psycho Education of caregivers – Improve Distance Learning via Case Conferencing and Best Practice Demonstration Across the National Boundaries – Create Data Base over cross-cultural and other select skills professionals within EU},

The welcome sign on the Statue of Liberty that reads, “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” however, is fading and has been replaced by many complicated conditions. What to do with the very large number of undocumented immigrants living in the United States and arriving at the United States every day commands considerable attention and has been the subject of breaking stories in the news. Working in the field of immigration demands an awareness of and sensitivity to diversity and cultural competence. Despite a “hot” sociopolitical climate when it comes to undocumented aliens and what to do with them, there are many ethical tenets that psychologists must be familiar with, among them rendering competent multicultural services. This article offers an overview of immigration law, the challenges of performing culturally competent assessments and consequences of failing to do so, and the plight of a particularly vulnerable group: unaccompanied children.

Several hierarchical regression analyses of ethnicity and PD on subjective mental and physical health (assessed using the health-related quality of life items, HRQLSF-12) were carried out separately for men and women.ResultsMale immigrants from Colombia and Sub-Saharan Africa showed better physical health than natives, controlling for age and socioeconomic and marital status. The immigrants – except for the Colombians – had poorer mental health than natives, especially African men and Bolivian women. Socioeconomic status had no impact on these differences. Among immigrants, PD was the best predictor of physical and mental health (controlling for socio-demographic variables). African men, Bolivian women and women without legal status exhibited the poorest self-rated mental health.ConclusionClear differences in health status among natives and immigrants were recorded. The self-selection hypothesis was plausible for physical health of Colombians and Sub-Saharan African men. Acculturation stress could explain poorer mental health in immigrants compared with natives. The association between ethnicity and poor self-reported mental health appears to be partially mediated by discrimination.},

Many people think that all migrants to Europe have meaningful access to healthcare. As article 35 of the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights recognises, “Everyone has the right of access to preventive health care and the right to benefit from medical treatment”.1

But the reality is different: as the European Parliament acknowledged in 2013, “Access to the most basic healthcare services, such as emergency care, is severely limited, if not impossible, for undocumented migrants on account of the identification requirement, the high price of treatment and the fear of being detected and reported to the authorities.”2

	abstract = {Chronic venous insufficiency is a prevalent disease that frequently leads to development of venous leg ulcers. While a number of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have been developed that provide guidance for clinicians when caring for patients with chronic venous insufficiency, they lack adequate detail concerning selection and application of compression for prevention and management of venous leg ulcers. In order to address this need, the WOCN Society appointed a task force to develop an algorithm for compression for primary prevention, treatment, and prevention of recurrent venous leg ulcers in persons with chronic venous insufficiency. The task force used findings from a scoping literature review to identify current best evidence needed to support decision points and pathways within the algorithm. In addition, the task force convened a panel of 20 clinicians and researchers with expertise in lower extremity venous disorders in order to establish consensus around pathways and decision points within the algorithm lacking robust evidence. Following initial construction of the algorithm, a second interdisciplinary group of expert clinicians established content validity and provided additional qualitative feedback used to complete final revisions of the algorithm. This article reviews the process used to create this landmark algorithm, including generation of the evidence- and consensus-based statements used in its construction, the various pathways, and rich supplemental materials embedded within the algorithm, and the process used to establish content validity.},

	abstract = {Background Footwear and ofﬂoading techniques are commonly used in clinical practice for preventing and healing of foot ulcers in persons with diabetes. The goal of this systematic review is to assess the medical scientiﬁc literature on this topic to better inform clinical practice about effective treatment.
Methods We searched the medical scientiﬁc literature indexed in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane database for original research studies published since 1 May 2006 related to four groups of interventions: (1) casting; (2) footwear; (3) surgical ofﬂoading; and (4) other ofﬂoading interventions. Primary outcomes were ulcer prevention, ulcer healing, and pressure reduction. We reviewed both controlled and non-controlled studies. Controlled studies were assessed for methodological quality, and extracted key data was presented in evidence and risk of bias tables. Uncontrolled studies were assessed and summarized on a narrative basis. Outcomes are presented and discussed in conjunction with data from our previous systematic review covering the literature from before 1 May 2006.
Results We included two systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 32 randomized controlled trials, 15 other controlled studies, and another 127 noncontrolled studies. Several randomized controlled trials with low risk of bias show the efﬁcacy of therapeutic footwear that demonstrates to relief plantar pressure and is worn by the patient, in the prevention of plantar foot ulcer recurrence. Two meta-analyses show non-removable ofﬂoading to be more effective than removable ofﬂoading for healing plantar neuropathic forefoot ulcers. Due to the limited number of controlled studies, clear evidence on the efﬁcacy of surgical ofﬂoading and felted foam is not yet available. Interestingly, surgical ofﬂoading seems more effective in preventing than in healing ulcers. A number of controlled and uncontrolled studies show that plantar pressure can be reduced by several conservative and surgical approaches.
Conclusions Sufﬁcient evidence of good quality supports the use of nonremovable ofﬂoading to heal plantar neuropathic forefoot ulcers and therapeutic footwear with demonstrated pressure relief that is worn by the patient to prevent plantar foot ulcer recurrence. The evidence base to support the use of other ofﬂoading interventions is still limited and of variable quality. The evidence for the use of interventions to prevent a ﬁrst foot ulcer or heal ischemic, infected, non-plantar, or proximal foot ulcers is practically non-existent. High-quality controlled studies are needed in these areas. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Paronychia is inflammation of the fingers or toes in one or more of the three nail folds. Acute paronychia is caused by polymicrobial infections after the protective nail barrier has been breached. Treatment consists of warm soaks with or without Burow solution or 1\% acetic acid. Topical antibiotics should be used with or without topical steroids when simple soaks do not relieve the inflammation. The presence of an abscess should be determined, which mandates drainage. There are a variety of options for drainage, ranging from instrumentation with a hypodermic needle to a wide incision with a scalpel. Oral antibiotics are usually not needed if adequate drainage is achieved unless the patient is immunocompromised or a severe infection is present. Therapy is based on the most likely pathogens and local resistance patterns. Chronic paronychia is characterized by symptoms of at least six weeks’ duration and represents an irritant dermatitis to the breached nail barrier. Common irritants include acids, alkalis, and other chemicals used by housekeepers, dishwashers, bartenders, florists, bakers, and swimmers. Treatment is aimed at stopping the source of irritation while treating the inflammation with topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors. More aggressive techniques may be required to restore the protective nail barrier. Treatment may take weeks to months. Patient education is paramount to reduce the recurrence of acute and chronic paronychia.},

Both national and international regulations and the Istanbul Protocol are of great importance in terms of elimination of maltreatment and torture. In this study, we evaluated whether examinations for custody of immigrants were performed in accordance with the Istanbul Protocol.
Method: We retrospectively evaluated reports of forensic examinations for custody of 100 immigrants in Van-C¸ aldıran Government Hospital in 2009. Data about nationality, age, gender, examination date, referring department, examination ﬁndings and departments to which the reports were submitted were collected.
Results: Fifty percent of the immigrants were Iranian and they were aged between 11 and 62 years. Ninety-nine immigrants were men and one was woman. Data about history of arrest were missing in forensic reports about all immigrants. Data about signs of trauma were present only for seven immigrants. Ninety-three immigrants were reported to have no signs of trauma. None of the immigrants underwent psychiatric examination. All forensic reports were found to be submitted to the police personally. Whether the immigrants were examined before or after the custody was not clear in the reports.
Conclusion: Evaluation of the data showed that none of the forensic examinations were performed in accordance with the Istanbul Protocol. It can be recommended that the protocol should be incorporated into the curricula for undergraduate, graduate and in-service training programmes in order to improve relevant forensic practices.},

	abstract = {Objectives. The aim of the present study was to investigate healthcare provider perceptions of the impact of refugee patients at two public hospitals, one rural and one urban, in designated refugee resettlement areas. Healthcare professionals’ views regarding improvements that could be made in this area were also sought.
Methods. Two-page anonymous questionnaires containing demographic, quantitative and open-ended questions were distributed to 150 healthcare providers at each research site.
Results. Response rates at the rural and urban sites were 50\% and 49\%, respectively. Refugees were seen at least monthly by 40\% of respondents. Additional support was requested by 70\% of respondents. Conﬁdence was associated with being born overseas (P = 0.029) and increased time working with refugees (rs = 0.418, P {\textless} 0.001). Only 47\% of respondents felt conﬁdent managing social and psychological needs of refugees. Midwives saw refugees more than nursing and allied healthcare staff combined, and this was signiﬁcant at the rural hospital (P {\textless} 0.001). Rural respondents reported that working with refugees enhanced their practice (P = 0.025), although felt signiﬁcantly less conﬁdent (P {\textless} 0.001) than urban respondents. Themes that arose regarding barriers to care included language and cultural barriers, paucity of knowledge and issues accessing available services, including appropriate interpreters, Medicare eligibility and patient factors, including lack of patient trust in government systems. Desire for support was more pronounced in the rural setting (P = 0.001).
Conclusions. Refugees were seen frequently in both settings and most respondents requested additional support, highlighting that caring for refugees in Australian hospitals is a signiﬁcant challenge. Additional support and education should be targeted to those caring for refugees most frequently, particularly midwifery services, to reduce barriers to care.},

	abstract = {An international telepsychiatry service was established between Denmark and Sweden for cross-cultural patient groups, such as asylum seekers, refugees and migrants. Over an 18-month period starting in mid 2006, 30 patients were treated by telepsychiatry (21 men and 9 women). The patients received mental health care by videoconferencing from providers who spoke the patients’ own language, i.e. without the assistance of interpreters. The total number of telepsychiatry sessions was 203 (range 1– 22; average 6.8 sessions per patient). Patients completed a satisfaction questionnaire at the end of treatment. Seven patients (23\%) were not able to complete a questionnaire, due to illiteracy and/or a psychotic condition. The rest of the patients (n¼23) reported a high level of acceptance and satisfaction with telepsychiatry, as well as a willingness to use it again or recommend it to others. Any disadvantages of telemedicine were compensated by the fact that the doctor and patient spoke the same language and had similar cultural and/or national references. Mentally ill asylum seekers, refugees and migrants are under-served in their mother tongue and telepsychiatry can improve access to scarce health-care resources.},

	abstract = {Objective. To demonstrate the suitability of accessing interpreters via videoconference for medical consultations and to assess doctor and patient perceptions of this compared with either on-site or telephone interpreting.
Methods. We assessed the suitability and acceptability of accessing interpreters via videoconference during outpatient clinical consultations in two situations: (i) when the doctor and patient were in a consulting room at a central hospital and the interpreter sat remotely; and (ii) when the doctor, patient and interpreter were each at separate sites (during a telehealth consultation). The main outcome measures were patient and doctor satisfaction, number of problems recorded and acceptability compared with other methods for accessing an interpreter.
Results. Ninety-eight per cent of patients were satisﬁed overall with the use of an interpreter by video. When comparing videoconference interpreting with telephone interpreting, 82\% of patients thought having an interpreter via video was better or much better, 15\% thought it was the same and 3\% considered it worse. Compared with on-site interpreting, 16\% found videoconferencing better or much better, 58\% considered it the same and 24\% considered it worse or much worse.
Conclusions. The present study has demonstrated that accessing an interpreter via videoconference is well accepted and preferred to telephone interpreting by both doctors and patients.},

	abstract = {The growing Canadian immigration detention system touches upon the lives of thousands of people daily. However, despite signiﬁcant legal and normative problems, the Canadian detention system seems to be escaping sustained scrutiny. To address this gap, we employ the rubric of “access to justice” to refocus on inequalities being reproduced in the legal system that impede fair, unprejudiced, and non-arbitrary treatment for minorities and vulnerable people. If law is meant to govern equally and to ensure against arbitrary deprivations of liberty, immigration detainees should not be placed outside its reaches. Yet, our examination of access to justice in the Canadian detention system demonstrates that exactly this sort of displacement is occurring. Above and beyond the basic deprivation of liberty and setback to immigrants and asylum-seekers’ interests, detention inﬂicts irreparable psychological, physical, and social damage. We point to issues such as deteriorating daily detention conditions, far-ﬂung facilities locations, unfair discretionary decision-making, lack of options for women, children, and vulnerable people, the compounding reasons for indeﬁnite detention, and inadequate legal aid and access to counsel. Canada is propagating an extremely costly and ineffective system of administrative detention that is often in contravention of national and international standards on immigration detention.},

	abstract = {Patients with psychiatric disorders or problems need specialists to correctly diagnose and treat their psychiatric issues. However, a lot of psychiatric patients, especially the patients living rural and remote communities, cannot get timely effective treatment or they lack appropriate care because they cannot access to quality mental health treatment. Telepsychiatry is an effective means of delivering quality psychiatric care and services. Telepsychiatry patients benefit from reduced travel, less lost work time, shorter waiting time for specialist referrals, and reduced costs. Telepsychiatry has gained high levels of satisfaction in all age groups, including the elderly. It is especially useful in rural areas where access to quality psychiatric care is limited or non-existent. Telepsychiatry often uses two-way, real time, interactive and video based services on the network to deliver psychiatric care. This paper introduces several telepsychiatry service delivery models, advantages and applications of telepsychiatry, and the technology such as videoconferencing and variables such as bandwidth used in telepsychiatry treatment sessions. Some technology progress such as mobile telepsychiatry, telepsychiatry based on cloud computing, and telepsychiatry information security based on cryptographic technology or biometrics is presented in this paper. Issues about cultures and languages in telepsychiatry, and limitations and challenges of telepsychiatry in technology and services, ethical and legal considerations of the telepsychiatry, syndromes and patients groups at significantly increased risk in telepsychiatry, patient-psychiatrist relationship in telepsychiatry, and future or further research in telepsychiatry are also discussed.},
